# Self hosted wishlist
An open source, self hosted alternative to things like the Amazon Wishlist, that can be shared with friends and family. You can create multiple lists and others can reserve items on a list as "bought". These reservations will be publicly visible to avoid duplicate gifts, but will only be revealed to you after a certain date.
